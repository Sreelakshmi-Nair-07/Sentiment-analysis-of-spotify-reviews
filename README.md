In an increasingly dynamic digital landscape, understanding how customer sentiment evolves over time has become crucial for driving retention and revenue growth. Traditional sentiment analysis methods, which treat customer reviews as isolated events, often overlook the temporal patterns that reflect shifting customer perceptions and behaviours. This oversight can prevent businesses from recognizing early warning signs of dissatisfaction, such as churn risk, or from capitalizing on emerging positive trends. To bridge this gap, the present study focuses on tracking and forecasting sentiment dynamics among Spotify users by analyzing textual reviews and engagement metrics over time. By modelling the progression of sentiment, the research aims to reveal patterns that signal behavioural changes, enabling timely and targeted interventions. This temporal approach to sentiment analysis provides a more nuanced understanding of customer experience, allowing Spotify to proactively enhance satisfaction, loyalty, and strategic decision-making. The goal is to analyze and forecast sentiment dynamics in Spotify customer reviews, to support revenue and retention strategies.
