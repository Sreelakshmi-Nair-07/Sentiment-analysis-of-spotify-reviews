In an increasingly dynamic digital landscape, understanding
how customer sentiment evolves over time has become cru-
cial for driving retention and revenue growth. Traditional sen-
timent analysis methods, which treat customer reviews as iso-
lated events, often overlook the temporal patterns that reflect
shifting customer perceptions and behaviors. This oversight
can prevent businesses from recognizing early warning signs
of dissatisfaction, such as churn risk, or from capitalizing on
emerging positive trends.

forecasting sentiment dynamics among Spotify users by ana-

lyzing textual reviews and engagement metrics over time. By
modeling the progression of sentiment, the research aims to re-
veal patterns that signal behavioral changes, enabling timely
and targeted interventions. This temporal approach to senti-
ment analysis provides a more nuanced understanding of cus-
tomer experience, allowing Spotify to proactively enhance sat-
isfaction, loyalty, and strategic decision-making. The goal is to
analyze and forecast sentiment dynamics in Spotify customer
reviews, to support revenue and retention strategies.
