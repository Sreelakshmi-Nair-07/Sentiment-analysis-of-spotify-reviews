# Sentiment Analysis and Thematical Analysis of spotify reviews 
 Customer reviews offer more than just overall sentiment, they highlight the specific themes and features users care about the most. Traditional sentiment analysis provides polarity (positive/negative), but it often overlooks which issues matter most to the customers and where the businesses should focus their efforts.

This project enhances sentiment analysis by combining RoBERTa-based sentiment classification with thematic analysis and weighted prioritization of concerns. By leveraging user engagement signals such as thumbsCount, this project  work identifies not only the sentiment but also the relative importance of different themes in Spotify reviews.

The outcome is a structured framework that helps businesses understand customer priorities, differentiate between minor complaints and high-impact issues, and make data-driven product or service improvements.

## Objectives

Perform thematic analysis to identify key recurring topics within both sentiment categories.

Apply thumbsCount weighting to rank themes by importance and highlight high-priority issues/features.

Visualize insights using word clouds and thematic distributions to provide intuitive, actionable findings.
